# USU-GAME-JAM-2025

Don't look at the history on this one, it was my first time using GitHub...

Regardless this is a dub for sure. Shout out to my mans "This John" for starring in the game, we couldn't do it without you.

## Roles
### Austin
Player controller, out of pocket guy, basic vibes.
### Will
Graphics or anything remotely pretty. GOAT.
### Kaden
Text and sprites or anything clickable. Please give your variables longer names...
### Brayden
